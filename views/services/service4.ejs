                                    SpyAxe, SpywareSheriff, Pest Trap, SpyTrooper, Spywareno, and MalwareAlarm, this type of malware disguises itself as an anti-spyware program and attempts to mislead the user into buying the program by repeatedly informing
                                    them of false threats. Such programs are notorious for hijacking the user's computer system and information, usually programmed to find credit card information.</p>
